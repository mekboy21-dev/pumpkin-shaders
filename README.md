## Pumpkin Shaders
A shader designed to boost the vanilla style while still attempting to stay performant.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This shader is in early stages of development and you may experience issues while playing. Shadows are still experimental.

Tested on Windows & Linux.

### Why pumpkin?
I opened Minecraft, went to a village and saw a pumpkin. Thats kinda just it.
